# Docker

## Initial concepts

- Client-server architecture: initialially on premise, later on cloud
- Cloud Solution Providers: AWS, Azure, GCP. Resources became available by monthly billing or by use.
- Virtualization: software that simulates the physical hardware
  - Used for optimize hardware usage and performance
  - Initially uses "Hypervisor" to manage virtual machines
- Microsservices: small, isolated applications that are isolated from each other
  - Communicate by APIs
  - We can scale them using VMs, or better: containers
- Containers: aggregate an App and its dependencies on an execution time environment
  - Isolated, can be deployed in different environments
