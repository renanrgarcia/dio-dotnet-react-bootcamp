# Api Intro

- API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of protocols, routines, and tools for building software applications. Communication between different software components.
- Example:
  - Application/Costumer: request an order (don't care about the details of the kitchen)
  - API/Waiter: accept an order and serve it
  - Server/Kitchen: serve an order (don't care about the details of the costumer)
- Pratical examples: date.nager.at / dog.ceo/dog-api
- Another examples:
  - Empresa Ecommerce > API entregas > Empresa Transportes (External API)
  - Frontend > Backend API > Database (Internal API)

# .NET Web API

- `dotnet new webapi -controllers` // creates a new web api project with controllers
- `dotnet watch run` // start the web api project and watch for changes
- Swagger comes with the project

## Controllers

- Controllers are the entry points for your API. They are used to define the routes and HTTP methods for your API. You can define multiple controllers if you want to organize your API in multiple files.
- Data annotations:
  - [ApiController], [Route("api/[controller]")], [HttpGet("actionName")], [HttpPost], [HttpPut], [HttpDelete], [HttpPatch]
- Each controller has a session on Swagger.
