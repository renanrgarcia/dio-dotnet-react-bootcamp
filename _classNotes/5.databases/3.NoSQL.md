# NoSQL

- SQL - scales on vertical form, demanding more computer resources. The exception is the SQL cluster, but it grows on horizontal form just for replicating data.
  - Schema: table, row, column, PK, FK
  - Performance: depends on disk system
  - Transactions: ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability)
- NoSQL - scales natively on horizontal form. Node sharding is the most common example of NoSQL.
  - Schema: there are no previously rules (schema-free/schemaless)
  - Performance: depends on cluster size and network bandwidth
  - Transactions: BaSE (Basically available, Soft-state, Eventually consistent)
- More used: MongoDB, Redis, Cassandra, Neo4j (Graphs)
- Types: document, key-value, graph, wide-column store

## Graphs

- Graph: a collection of nodes and edges
- Neo4j used cypher language for queries
