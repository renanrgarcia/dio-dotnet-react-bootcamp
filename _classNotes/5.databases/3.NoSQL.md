# NoSQL

- SQL - scales on vertical form, demanding more computer resources. The exception is the SQL cluster, but it grows on horizontal form just for replicating data.
  - Schema: table, row, column, PK, FK
  - Performance: depends on disk system
  - Transactions: ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability)
- NoSQL - scales natively on horizontal form. Node sharding is the most common example of NoSQL.
  - Schema: there are no previously rules (schema-free/schemaless)
  - Performance: depends on cluster size and network bandwidth
  - Transactions: BaSE (Basically available, Soft-state, Eventually consistent)
- More used: MongoDB, Redis, Cassandra (column/column family), Neo4j (Graphs)
- Types: document, key-value, graph, wide-column store

## Graphs

- Graph: a collection of nodes and edges
- `Neo4j` used cypher language for queries

## Column/Column family

- Column: a collection of rows, only reserve space for the filled columns
- `Cassandra` (Facebook created based on Bigtable - Google) uses CQL (Cassandra Query Language) for queries
  - katacoda.com
- Focus on reading data in high volume, consuming data by its Primary Key
- Concepts:
  - Keyspace (Database) - group of columns families
  - Column family/table (Table) - group of columns
  - Row key (PK) - represents one column's row
  - Column - represents a value (Name, Value, Timestamp)
- Uses examples: transactions registrer (puchase records, test results, etc)

## Key/value

- Key: unique identifier; value: data
- Good performance on cloud, bad search capability
- `Redis`: used to DB, cache, message broker and queue
  - High performance, data structure on memory, versatile, replicating and persistent data
  - try.redis.io

## Document

- Data and documents autocontained and autodescribed. Permits redundance and inconsistency. Free of schemas, using JSON, XML, CSV, etc.
- `MongoDB`

## MongoDB

- Open source, High performance, Schema-free, uses JSON to store data (BSON - Binary JSON: key-value)
- Index is used to search, auto-sharding (horizontal scaling), map-reduce (aggregation to process data), GridFS (file storage)
- Rich Query language, focus on great data volume, not necessarily structured
- Accepts JavaScript commands
- When not to use:
  - Need for relationships/joins
  - ACID properties and transactions are important
  - Some payment entities don't homologue systems with DBs different than relational ones
- Items
  - Document => Tuple/Record
  - Collection => Table
  - Embedding/linking => Join
- Good practices
  - Avoid too large documents
  - Use objectives and short field names
  - Analyse and optimize queries using `explain()`
  - Update only the fields that are changing
  - Avoid negation on querys
  - Lists/arrays can't grow limitlessly

### Schema Design

- Embedding

  - Autocontained Document (Reference inside the document - sub-document)
  - Ex:

  ```JSON
  {
    "name": "John",
    "addresses": [
      {
        "street": "10th Street",
        "city": "New York"
      },
      {
        "street": "20th Street",
        "city": "New York"
      }
    ]
  }
  ```

  - Recommended to One-to-one relationship (Key/Value)
  - Recommended to One-to-few relationship (Sub-document)
  - Pros:
    - Only one query to the database
    - Update register in only one operation
  - Cons:
    - 16 MB per document

- Reference

  - Dependency of another documents or collections
  - Ex:

  ```JSON
  {
    "name": "John",
    "address": [ // reference to another objects
      ObjectId("1234"),
      ObjectId("5678")
    ]
  }
  ```

  - Recommended to One-to-many/Many-to-many relationship (Reference)
  - Pros:
    - Smaller documents
    - No duplicated information
    - Used when data not acessed in every query
  - Cons:
    - Two or more query or $lookup using

### JSON/BSON

- BSON = JSON with binary values
- BSON has some types: ObjectID, Date, etc

### CLI commands

- `mongo --host 127.0.0.1:27017 -u user -p password`: connect to the database
- `use dbname`: select or create the database
- `db.collection("name", {options})`: explicit select or create the collection with the options
- `db.collection.insertOne("name": "value"})`: insert a document on the collection | implicit create a collection if it doesn't exist
- `db.collection.insert({"name": "value"}, {"name2": "value2"})`: insert multiple documents on the collection
- `db.collection.find("name": "value"})`: find documents on the collection
- `db.collection.find("name": "value"}).limit(10)`: find documents on the collection, limited to 10 results
- `db.collection.find({"name": {$in: ["value1", "value2"]}})`: find documents with the values (same field)
- `db.collection.find({$or: [{"name": "value1"}, {"name2": "value2"}]})`: find documents with the values (different fields)
- `db.collection.find({"name": {$lt: 10}})`: find documents with the value less than 10
- `db.collection.find({"name": {$lte: 10}})`: find documents with the value less or equal than
- `db.collection.find({})`: find all documents on the collection
- `db.collection.save("Id": ObjectId(), "name": "value", "name2": "value2"})`: creates or updates a document
- `db.collection.update({"filterName": "filterValue"}, {$set: {"name": "value"}})`: update a document
- `db.collection.update({"filterName": "filterValue"}, {$set: {"name": "value"}}, {multi: true})`: update all documents with the filter
- `db.collection.updateMany({"filterName": "filterValue"}, {$set: {"name": "value"}})`: update all documents with the filter
- `db.collection.deleteOne({"filterName": "filterValue"})`: delete the first matching document
- `db.collection.deleteMany({"filterName": "filterValue"})`: delete all matching documents
- `*.explain()`: details of the query results

### Performance and indexes

- `db.GetCollection("name").createIndex({name: 1}, {"name": "indexName"})`: create an index

### Aggregations

- Aggregation is a pipeline of operations on steps, where each step is used on the result of the previous step
- Types:

#### Unique purpose

- They can't be costumized
- `count`: count the number of documents
- `distinct`: return the distinct values in the collection

#### Pipeline

- Composed by filters and operators
- `db.GetCollection("name").aggregate([{$group: {_id: "$name", count: {$sum: 1}}}])`: group by name and count the number of documents
- `db.GetCollection("name").aggregate([{$addFields: {test: true}}])`: add a new field, but don't save it in the database
- Functions: `$sum`, `$avg`, `$min`, `$max`, `$addToSet`, `$push`
- `db.GetCollection("name").aggregate([{$match: {$and: [{"name": "value"}, {"name2: "value2"}}])`: match documents with both values
- `db.GetCollection("name").aggregate([{$match: {$or: [{"name": "value"}, {"name2: "value2"}}])`: match documents with any values
