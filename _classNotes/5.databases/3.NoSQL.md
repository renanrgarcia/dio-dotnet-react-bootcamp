# NoSQL

- SQL - scales on vertical form, demanding more computer resources. The exception is the SQL cluster, but it grows on horizontal form just for replicating data.
  - Schema: table, row, column, PK, FK
  - Performance: depends on disk system
  - Transactions: ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability)
- NoSQL - scales natively on horizontal form. Node sharding is the most common example of NoSQL.
  - Schema: there are no previously rules (schema-free/schemaless)
  - Performance: depends on cluster size and network bandwidth
  - Transactions: BaSE (Basically available, Soft-state, Eventually consistent)
- More used: MongoDB, Redis, Cassandra (column/column family), Neo4j (Graphs)
- Types: document, key-value, graph, wide-column store

## Graphs

- Graph: a collection of nodes and edges
- `Neo4j` used cypher language for queries

## Column/Column family

- Column: a collection of rows, only reserve space for the filled columns
- `Cassandra` (Facebook created based on Bigtable - Google) uses CQL (Cassandra Query Language) for queries

- Focus on reading data in high volume, consuming data by its Primary Key
- Concepts:
  - Keyspace (Database) - group of columns families
  - Column family/table (Table) - group of columns
  - Row key (PK) - represents one column's row
  - Column - represents a value (Name, Value, Timestamp)
- Uses examples: transactions registrer (puchase records, test results, etc)

## Key/value

- Key: unique identifier; value: data
- Good performance on cloud, bad search capability
- `Redis`: used to DB, cache, message broker and queue
  - High performance, data structure on memory, versatile, replicating and persistent data
  - try.redis.io

## Document

- Data and documents autocontained and autodescribed. Permits redundance and inconsistency. Free of schemas, using JSON, XML, CSV, etc.
- `MongoDB`
