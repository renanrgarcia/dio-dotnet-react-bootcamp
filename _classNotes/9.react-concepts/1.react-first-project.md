# Creating first project

- Babel is a JavaScript compiler for a version that all browsers support
- `npm init -y`: create a project using package.json file containing all initial information
- `@babel/core @babel/preset-env @babel/preset-react babel-loader -D`:
  - @babel/core: The core Babel package that provides the fundamental functionality for transforming JavaScript code.
  - @babel/preset-env: A Babel preset that automatically determines the necessary plugins to transform modern JavaScript syntax for older environments.
  - @babel/preset-react: A Babel preset specifically for React projects, adding the necessary plugins to transform JSX syntax.
  - babel-loader: A Webpack loader that integrates Babel into the Webpack build process, enabling the transpilation of JavaScript files.
  - The -D at the end indicates these are development dependencies, used during development and build, but not included in the final production bundle.
- .babelrc: Babel configuration file
