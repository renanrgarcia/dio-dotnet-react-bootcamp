# Unit Tests

- Test types: unit, integration, end-to-end, regression, security, etc.
- Unit test: test a single function or method (tiny code as possible) directly on the source code
  - Test cases: a set of inputs that should result in a specific output
- Advantages of tests:
  - Quality assurance
  - Ensure that alterations to the code don't break the tests
  - Less bugs
  - More confidence on classes and methods
  - Prevent future regressions

## Test Frameworks

- xUnit
- MS Test
- NUnit

## xUnit

- `dotnet new xunit`: create a new xUnit test project
- `dotnet
- Concepts:
  - `[Fact]`: This attribute is used to mark a method as a test method.
  - `[Theory]`: This attribute is used to mark a parameterized test method.
    - `[InlineData]`: This attribute is used to pass data to a parameterized test method.
  - `Arrange`: set up everything needed for the test
  - `Act`: you perform the action or behavior that you want to test
  - `Assert`: verify that the outcome of the action matches your expectations
- `dotnet test`: run the tests
- `dotnet test --filter "FullyQualifiedName=MyNamespace.MyClass.MyTestMethod"`: run a specific test
