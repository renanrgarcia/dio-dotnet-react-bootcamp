# Introduction

## Pillars of OOP

- `Abstraction`: refers to providing only necessary information about the data to the outside world, hiding the background info or implementation.
- `Encapsulation`: defined as wrapping up of Data and Information under a single unit and binding them with the functions that manipulate them. Encapsulation also leads to data abstraction or hiding.
- `Inheritance`: two classes have a relationship with each other, and objects of one class acquire properties and features of the other class.
- `Polymorphism`: provides a function or an operator with more than one definition. It can be implemented using function overloading, operator overload, function overriding, virtual function.

## Paradigms of programming

- OOP
- Procedural
- Structural
- Imperative
- Event-driven
- Logical

## Encapsulation

- private props, possible to change only from within the class. When can make public methods to access private props.

## Inheritance

- Example: `public class Student : Person`
- It's possible having multiple inheritance. Ex: Person -> Teacher -> Director

## Polymorphism

- Execution time polymorphism (Override/Late binding):

```cs
public class Shape
{
  public virtual void Draw()
  {
    Console.WriteLine("Drawing...");
  }
}

public class Circle : Shape
{
  public override void Draw()
  {
    Console.WriteLine("Drawing a circle...");
  }
}
```

- Compilation time polymorphism (Overload/Early binding):

```cs
public class Calculator
{
  public int Sum(int a, int b)
  {
    Console.WriteLine("Drawing...");
  }

  public int Sum(int a, int b, int c)
  {
    Console.WriteLine("Drawing...");
  }
}

```
