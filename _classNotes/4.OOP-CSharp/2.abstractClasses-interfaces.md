# Abstract classes

- Classes that cannot be instantiated, it can only be inherited
- We can implement abstract methods or not
- Example:

```cs
public abstract class Account
{
  public int Id { get; set; }
  public string Number { get; set; }
  public double Balance { get; set; }
  public abstract void Withdraw(double amount);
  public abstract void Deposit(double amount);
}

public class CheckingAccount : Account
{
  public override void Withdraw(double amount) { };
  public override void Deposit(double amount) { };
}
```

## Inherited constructors

- We can inherit constructors
- To pass arguments to the inherited constructor, we use the `base` keyword

# Sealed classes

- Classes that cannot be inherited, but can inherit other classes
- There are properties and methods sealed too
- Example:

```cs
public sealed class Account
{
  public sealed void Withdraw(double amount) { };

  public sealed override void Deposit(double amount) { };
}
```

# Object Class

- `System.Object` is the parent of all classes. Its objective is to provide low level functionality for all classes.
- Methods:
  - `Equals(Object)`: determines if the object is equal to the specified object
  - `Equals(Object, Object)`: compares two instances of objects for equality
  - `Finalize()`: cleans up resources used by the object before it is reclaimed by garbage collection
  - `GetHashCode()`: returns a hash code for the object
  - `GetType()`: returns the type of the object
  - `MemberwiseClone()`: creates a shallow copy of the object
  - `ReferenceEquals(Object, Object)`: determines if two instances of objects are the same
  - `ToString()`: returns a string representation of the object

# Interfaces

- Interfaces are contracts that classes must implement. Cannot be instantiated, it's similar to abstract classes
- Example:

```cs
public interface ICalculator
{
  double Sum(double a, double b);
  double Sub(double a, double b);
}

public class CientificCalculator : ICalculator // Implements ICalculator
{
  public double Sum(double a, double b) => a + b;
  public double Sub(double a, double b) => a - b;
}
```

- Methods that are not implemented will throw an error, except for the interface methods that have a default implementation
