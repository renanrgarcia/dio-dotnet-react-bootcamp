# React

- Is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- It allows us to create reusable UI components.
- Objective: optmize update and syncrhronize data
- Simplyfied way to connect HTML, CSS and JS

## Framework vs Library

- Library: is a collection of reusable code that can be used in different projects. Shared solutions with functions and methods.
  - Exs: Moment, Chart, Voca, mo.js, etc.
- Framework: tool that helps us build apps, not in config details, already in code.
  - Exs: Angular, Vue, Next, Express, etc.

## First project

- `npx create-react-app app-name`: create a new React app
- `public/index.html`: contains the HTML code for the app
- `src/index.js`: contains the JavaScript code for the app. It's the entry point of the app.
  - Manipulate the DOM rendering the app with the 'root' element
- `package.json`: contains the package dependencies
- `jsx`: a syntax to write HTML inside JavaScript functions
- `npm run start`: starts the development server

## Class components

- It was used in the React library before.
- Ex:

```jsx
import React, { Component } from "react"; // Importing React and Component from the React library

export default class App extends Component {
  // Declaring and exporting the App component
  constructor(props) {
    // The constructor initializes the component state and binds event handlers
    super(props); // Calls the parent class constructor (Component) with the props
    this.state = { counter: 0 }; // Initializing the state with a counter set to 0
    this.handleClick = this.handleClick.bind(this); // Binding the handleClick method to the current instance
  }

  handleClick() {
    // Method to update the counter state when called
    this.setState({ counter: this.state.counter + 1 }); // Increments the counter by 1
  }

  render() {
    // The render method is responsible for rendering the component UI
    return <h1>Hello World</h1>; // This renders a simple "Hello World" heading to the DOM
  }
}
```

## Functional components

- It's used in the React library nowadays.
- Ex:

```jsx
import React, { useState } from "react"; // Importing useState hook to manage state

function App({ name }) {
  // Functional component named 'App' with 'name' as a prop
  const [counter, setCounter] = useState(0); // Initializing the 'counter' state, starting at 0

  const handleClick = () => {
    // A function to handle clicks and increment the counter
    setCounter(counter + 1); // Increments the counter by 1
  };

  return (
    <div className="App">
      {" "}
      {/* Corrected to className (for JSX) */}
      <p>Hello, {name}.</p> {/* Displays the 'name' prop */}
      <p>Counter: {counter}</p> {/* Displays the current counter value */}
      <button onClick={handleClick}>Increment Counter</button>{" "}
      {/* Button that triggers handleClick */}
    </div>
  );
}

export default App; // Exporting the 'App' component to be used elsewhere
```

## Components

- Components are reusable UI components.
- To use a component, you need to import it and render it in the JSX code.
  - import componentName from 'path/to/component';

## Props

- Props are used to pass data from one component to another.
- Ex:

```jsx
function App(props) {
  const { name } = props; // Destructuring the 'name' prop

  //code
}

or;

function App({ name }) {
  // code
}
```

## Lifecycle methods

1. Constructor: used to initialize the component
2. getDerivedStateFromProps: used to update the state based on the props
3. componentDidMount: used to run any code when the component is mounted
4. shouldComponentUpdate: used to determine if the component should update
5. render: used to render the component
6. getSnapshotBeforeUpdate: used to get a snapshot of the component before it is updated

- React compares the component on virtual DOM with the new props and state and decides if the component should update or not.
- After, it re-renders the component with the new props and state on the DOM.

7. componentDidUpdate: used to run any code when the component is updated
8. componentWillUnmount: used to run any code when the component is unmounted (e.g. when the component is removed from the DOM)

## Extras

- <> </>: Empty tags, used to group elements in JSX
- `yarn add styled-components`: Used to styling React components using CSS-in-JS. It allows you to write CSS styles directly inside your JavaScript files, and it ties the styles directly to specific components.
  - Scoped Styles: The styles are scoped to the component, meaning they won't leak into other parts of your app.
  - Dynamic Styling: You can pass props to styled components to dynamically change their styles.
  - Familiar Syntax: Styled Components use template literals to write CSS, so if you already know CSS, you can pick it up quickly.
  - Component-Based: Since the styles are attached to components, it encourages building UI in a modular, reusable way.
- `yarn add axios`: Used to make HTTP requests (e.g., to fetch or send data from/to a server) in both the browser and Node.js
  - Promise-based: Axios returns a Promise, which allows you to easily handle asynchronous operations using .then() and .catch().
  - Handles JSON: It automatically parses JSON responses, so you donâ€™t have to manually do it.
  - Supports HTTP Methods: It supports all common HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.
  - Easy to Configure: You can easily set request headers, query parameters, timeouts, and more.
  - Interceptors: Axios allows you to intercept requests or responses before they are handled. This is useful for things like logging or token authentication.
