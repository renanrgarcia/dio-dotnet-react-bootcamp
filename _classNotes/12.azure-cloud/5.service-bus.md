# Azure Service Bus

# Basic Concepts

- Message: a unit of raw data. Expect manipulation. Ex: JSON, XML, CSV, etc.
- Event: light notification of a condition or state change. It doesn't carry any data.

- Queue: a collection of messages from the producer until the consumer receives and processes them. Exs:

  - Data transfer
  - Application seggregation
  - Load balancing and damping
  - Etc.

- Topic: a collection of queues. They can have different subscriptions.

- Event Grid: tool focused on event sourcing. Works with pub/sub model.
  - That one that sends the event don't know who is the receiver.

# Create a Service Bus Application

1. Create a Service Bus Namespace

- Select pricing tier (Basic, Standard, Premium)
  - Standard can be used for both queues and topics

## Creating queues

2. Create a Service Bus Queue

- Read the properties and create

3. Create an Access Key

- For real applications we need a dedicated access key. For demo purposes we use the default key.

4. Create a Dotnet Application

- On the Program.cs add the services:
  - QueueConsumer.cs
  - QueueProducer.cs

5. Test the message consumption

- Enter the Service Bus Explorer on the Queue on Azure Portal and send messages

6. You can add scheduled messages
7. You can handle dead letters

## Create topics

8. Create a Service Bus Topic

- Read the properties and create

9. Create TopicProducer

10. Create a Topic Consumer
